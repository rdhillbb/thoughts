After reading your post and during my two-hour drive to the AI conference in San Jose, my mind scribbled through several disjointed thoughts.

The law is supposed to be blind, and some argue that it is. However, there is a major flaw in this thinking: the implementation of the law is influenced by personal bias. If those enforcing the law carry biases, then the law itself is not truly blind. That is the real problem.



My father was once arrested because a woman of non-color claimed he yelled at her. He revealed this to me years later when he was unable to co-sign a small business loan. I am grateful he wasn’t in Mississippi when it happened. I am sure my father did not as that is not his character. So, when was it a crime to yell at some one? I am sure there is no law on the book.

When a person is raised from birth to believe that a particular group is inherently “X,” cognitive dissonance and confirmation bias take root for life. If that person lacks critical thinking skills or the intellectual capacity to understand, they cannot change even with a two by four swung at them. You have a better chance of telling a tree to run to the store. The sad story is there are a large percentage of folks that fall in this category.

If you recognize certain percentage of the population have cognitive dissonance and poor critical thinking, they can be easily influenced, you can rally them. By doing so, you can manipulate them into acting against their own interests, distracting them while filling your pocket with their money.

Think about it. Make America Great Again. America is flawed. The US standing in the world only declined until the 45th and 47th president took office and stated it. (False Flag). Depending on what ethnic group are you are, from an internal perspective, “What do you mean Again”.

I live outside the U.S., and from my perspective, most Americans are largely unaware of the rest of the world. Their perceptions are shaped by certain news media that use vocabulary at a fourth-grade level, making it easy to lead them like the Pied Piper.

America has changed since I left in 1989. I enjoy diversity. Meeting people from other parts of the world, other religions, etc. I try to listen and learn and put my American ways in my back pocket.

Not sure if this post is relevant to your post.

 

The law should be blind, seeking understanding should be encouraged, science is real, etc.
